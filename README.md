# [platinum-extractor](https://cabalex.github.io/platinum-extractor)
A powerful web-based extractor for extracting and modding Platinum Games' games. It runs entirely in your browser-- no need to install anything!

A spiritual successor to [Astral Extractor](https://cabalex.github.io/astral-extractor).

## Issues/Feature Requests
If you find any major bugs or features you would like to see, don't hesitate to open an issue on GitHub. Please note I may not be able to get around to everything, nor do I own every game or can make every file extractable/moddable, so be patient! If you know how to implement something, you can maybe even open a pull request.

## Development
With v2.0, it's now much easier to add file types and visualizers! Simply visit this repository's wiki page.

My code is not the highest quality. Sorry.
